# Ransomware Protection: 7 Essential Steps for Utah Small Businesses

Ransomware attacks cost businesses an average of **$1.85 million per incident** in 2025, according to [Sophos](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/content/state-of-ransomware). For Utah small businesses, that's often enough to shut the doors permanently. The scary truth? **43% of cyberattacks now target small businesses**, and most don't have the IT resources to recover.

Whether you run a law firm in Salt Lake City, a medical practice in Provo, or a construction company in Lehi, ransomware doesn't discriminate. Here's how to protect your Utah business before it's too late.

## What Is Ransomware?

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts your files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access. Modern variants don't just lock your data—they steal it first, threatening to publish sensitive information if you don't pay.

**Common entry points include:**
- Phishing emails with malicious attachments
- Compromised remote desktop connections (RDP)
- Outdated software with unpatched vulnerabilities
- Infected USB drives or external devices

## 7 Essential Protection Steps

### 1. Implement the 3-2-1 Backup Rule

The single most important defense against ransomware is a solid backup strategy:

- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different storage types (local + cloud)
- **1** copy stored offsite or air-gapped

Critical: Test your backups regularly. A backup you can't restore is worthless. We recommend monthly restoration tests at minimum.

### 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Everywhere

MFA stops **99.9% of account compromise attacks** according to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/). Enable it on:

- Email accounts (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)
- VPN and remote access tools
- Banking and financial systems
- Cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive)
- Line-of-business applications

No excuses—if a system supports MFA, turn it on today.

### 3. Keep Systems Patched and Updated

Most ransomware exploits known vulnerabilities that already have patches available. The [WannaCry attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack) that hit 200,000 computers? Microsoft had released a patch two months earlier.

**Patch management essentials:**
- Enable automatic updates on all workstations
- Patch servers within 30 days of critical updates
- Retire end-of-life software (Windows 10 support ends October 2025!)
- Include network devices: firewalls, routers, switches

### 4. Train Your Team to Spot Phishing

Your employees are both your greatest vulnerability and your first line of defense. **91% of cyberattacks start with a phishing email.**

Effective training includes:
- Monthly phishing simulations
- Clear reporting procedures for suspicious emails
- Recognition (not punishment) for reporting attempts
- Regular updates on current threat tactics

Pro tip: Create a culture where employees feel safe reporting mistakes immediately. Early detection limits damage.

### 5. Segment Your Network

If ransomware gets in, network segmentation prevents it from spreading everywhere. Think of it like fire doors in a building—they contain the damage.

**Basic segmentation strategies:**
- Separate guest WiFi from business networks
- Isolate sensitive systems (accounting, HR, patient data)
- Limit user access to only what they need
- Use VLANs to create logical boundaries

### 6. Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Traditional antivirus isn't enough anymore. Modern EDR solutions provide:

- Real-time threat detection using AI
- Automatic isolation of infected devices
- Detailed forensics for incident response
- Protection against zero-day threats

Popular options include Microsoft Defender for Business, SentinelOne, and CrowdStrike—all available through managed IT providers.

### 7. Create an Incident Response Plan

When (not if) an attack happens, you need a plan. Document:

- Who to call first (IT provider, legal counsel, insurance)
- How to isolate affected systems
- Communication protocols for staff and customers
- Steps to restore from backups
- Regulatory notification requirements (HIPAA, PCI, etc.)

**Practice your plan** with tabletop exercises at least annually.

## Should You Pay the Ransom?

The FBI recommends against paying ransoms because:
- Payment funds criminal operations
- No guarantee you'll get your data back
- Paying makes you a target for future attacks
- Stolen data may be leaked anyway

With proper backups and an incident response plan, most businesses can recover without paying.

## The Cost of Doing Nothing

Utah businesses face real consequences:
- **Average downtime:** 21 days
- **Recovery costs:** $1.85 million (including lost business)
- **Reputation damage:** 60% of small businesses close within 6 months of a major cyber incident

Compare that to the cost of proper protection: typically $100-300/user/month for comprehensive managed IT security.
