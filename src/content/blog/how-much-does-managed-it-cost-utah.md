If you're a Utah business owner researching IT support options, one of your first questions is probably: *"What's this going to cost me?"*

It's a fair question — and one that's surprisingly hard to get a straight answer to. Most MSPs (Managed Service Providers) want you to "schedule a call" before revealing any numbers.

We believe in transparency. Here's what Utah businesses actually pay for managed IT services in 2025.

## The Short Answer

Most Utah small businesses pay between **$100-$250 per user per month** for comprehensive managed IT services. A 20-person company typically spends **$2,000-$5,000/month** for full IT support.

But that range is wide for a reason. Let's break down what affects the price.

## Common MSP Pricing Models

### Per-User Pricing
The most common model. You pay a flat monthly fee for each employee who uses IT services.

- **Basic support:** $75-$125/user/month
- **Standard (most popular):** $125-$175/user/month  
- **Premium with security:** $175-$250/user/month

**Example:** A 15-person law firm paying $150/user = $2,250/month

### Per-Device Pricing
Less common, but some MSPs charge per computer, server, or network device.

- **Workstations:** $50-$100/device/month
- **Servers:** $200-$500/server/month

### Tiered/Bundle Pricing
Many MSPs offer packages with different service levels:

| Tier | What's Included | Typical Cost |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Basic** | Help desk, monitoring, updates | $75-$100/user |
| **Standard** | Above + security, backup | $125-$175/user |
| **Premium** | Above + advanced security, compliance, vCIO | $200-$300/user |

## What Affects Your Price?

### 1. Company Size
Larger companies often get volume discounts. A 50-person company might pay $125/user while a 10-person company pays $150/user for the same service.

### 2. Industry & Compliance
Healthcare, finance, and legal firms need HIPAA, PCI, or other compliance — expect 20-40% higher costs for the additional security and documentation required.

### 3. Infrastructure Complexity
- Cloud-only (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace): Lower cost
- On-premise servers: Higher cost
- Hybrid environment: Varies

### 4. Current IT State
If your systems are outdated or poorly maintained, expect onboarding fees of $1,000-$10,000+ to get everything standardized and secure.

### 5. Location
Utah MSP pricing is generally 10-20% lower than coastal cities like San Francisco or New York, but aligned with Denver and Phoenix markets.

## What's Usually Included?

A standard managed IT package typically covers:

- **24/7 monitoring** of your systems
- **Help desk support** for employee issues
- **Patch management** (Windows updates, security patches)
- **Antivirus/anti-malware** protection
- **Basic backup** solutions
- **Network management**
- **Vendor coordination** (working with your software vendors)

### What Often Costs Extra

- **Projects** (office moves, new software rollouts)
- **Hardware** (computers, servers, networking equipment)
- **Advanced cybersecurity** (SIEM, SOC, penetration testing)
- **Compliance audits** (HIPAA, SOC 2)
- **After-hours emergency support** (some plans)

## The Hidden Cost of Cheap IT

We get it — budget matters. But the cheapest MSP isn't always the best value.

According to [IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach), the average data breach costs small businesses over $150,000. That's years of "savings" from a cut-rate IT provider wiped out in one incident.

Questions to ask before choosing the cheapest option:

- What's their response time guarantee?
- Do they include cybersecurity, or is it extra?
- What happens if you get ransomware at 2am on a Saturday?
- Are they proactive, or just reactive?
