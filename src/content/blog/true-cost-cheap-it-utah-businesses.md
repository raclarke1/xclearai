There's a conversation we have with Utah business owners at least once a week. It goes something like this:

*"We don't really need managed IT. My nephew handles our computers, and we use the free version of everything. It works fine."*

Then, about six months later, the same owner calls us in a panic. Their server crashed. Their "free" backup didn't actually back up anything. They're losing $8,000 a day in billable work. And suddenly, "saving money on IT" doesn't feel like such a great deal.

If you run a business in Utah with 10 to 200 employees, this article is for you. Let's talk about what IT actually costs — not just the number on the invoice, but the full picture that most business owners never see until it's too late.

## The IT Budget Reality Check

Here's a number that surprises most small business owners: according to [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology/articles/technology-budgets-for-small-business.html) and [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-9-point-8-percent-in-2026-exceeding-6-trillion-dollars-for-the-first-time), businesses with under $50 million in revenue typically spend between 4% and 6.9% of annual revenue on IT. Worldwide IT spending is projected to grow 9.8% in 2026, exceeding $6 trillion for the first time.

But here in Utah, we see a lot of businesses spending 1% to 2% of revenue on technology — and thinking they're being smart about it.

They're not. They're just deferring the cost.

Think of it like skipping oil changes on your truck. Sure, you save $50 every few months. But when the engine seizes at 80,000 miles, that "$50 savings" turns into a $6,000 repair. IT works exactly the same way.

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About

When you add up what cheap IT actually costs, the numbers are ugly. Here's what we see with businesses across the Wasatch Front:

**Employee downtime.** According to [CloudSecureTech](https://www.cloudsecuretech.com/cost-of-it-downtime-in-2025/), the average employee loses about 15 minutes per day to IT issues — slow computers, printer problems, forgotten passwords, software that won't load. That's $10.25 per employee per day in lost productivity. For a 50-person company, that's over $130,000 a year just evaporating into thin air.

**Major outages.** When your systems actually go down — not just slow, but down — the costs are staggering. Research from multiple industry sources puts the average cost of downtime for SMBs with 20 to 100 employees at roughly [$100,000 per hour](https://queue-it.com/blog/cost-of-downtime/). Even if you're on the smaller side, losing your email, phone system, or billing software for half a day can easily cost $10,000 to $25,000.

**Shadow IT.** When your official tools don't work well, employees find workarounds. They sign up for free file-sharing services. They use personal email for work documents. They store client data on personal phones. This isn't just inefficient — it's a compliance nightmare, especially if you're in healthcare or legal. And you won't even know it's happening until something goes wrong.

**Cyber incidents.** We covered this in our recent article on [manufacturing cybersecurity](/blog/cybersecurity-utah-manufacturers-2026), but the story is the same across industries. Businesses running outdated systems, unpatched software, and consumer-grade antivirus are sitting ducks. The average cost of a data breach for small businesses now exceeds $150,000 — and that's before you factor in lost clients and reputation damage.

## What "Budget IT" Actually Looks Like

Let's be specific about what we mean by cheap IT. We're talking about:

- **The nephew or "computer guy"** who does IT on the side. He's probably great at fixing your home Wi-Fi, but he doesn't know anything about [Active Directory group policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-policy/group-policy-overview), backup verification, or compliance frameworks.

- **Break-fix support** where you only call someone when something breaks. No monitoring. No proactive maintenance. No strategy. Just firefighting.

- **Consumer-grade tools** — free antivirus, residential internet connections, personal Dropbox accounts, and $300 laptops from the big-box store.

- **The "we'll deal with it later" approach** to updates, backups, and security. Spoiler: later always arrives at the worst possible time.

None of these are IT strategies. They're IT avoidance. And they always cost more in the long run.

## What Smart IT Budgeting Looks Like in 2026

So what should a Utah business actually spend on IT? Here's a practical framework:

**Per-user costs.** Managed IT services in 2026 typically run between $110 and $400 per user per month, depending on your industry and compliance needs. A 30-person professional services firm might spend $150 per user. A 30-person medical practice with HIPAA requirements might be at $250 per user. That sounds like a lot until you compare it to the cost of one bad day.

**The 5% rule.** If you're not sure where to start, aim for 5% of gross revenue on IT. That includes hardware, software licenses, support, cybersecurity, and strategic planning. For a $3 million Utah business, that's $150,000 per year — or about $12,500 per month. It sounds significant, but split across 25 to 30 employees, it's the cost of keeping your business running reliably.

**Capital vs. operating expense.** One of the biggest advantages of managed IT is converting unpredictable capital expenses (surprise server replacements, emergency repairs) into predictable monthly operating costs. Your CFO or accountant will thank you. According to [Gartner](https://www.saastr.com/gartner-enterprise-software-spend-will-grow-a-stunning-15-2-next-year-but-most-of-that-will-go-to-price-increases-and-ai-apps/), 9% of every IT budget in 2025-2026 is going just to pay more for the same software — price increases from vendors adding AI features. If you're not budgeting for that, you're falling behind.

## The ROI That Actually Matters

Let's do some real math for a typical Utah business — say a 40-person construction company doing $5 million in annual revenue.

**The cheap route:**
- Part-time IT guy: $2,000/month
- Consumer software and tools: $800/month
- Annual "surprise" costs (crashes, virus cleanup, emergency calls): $15,000-$30,000/year
- **Total: ~$50,000-$65,000/year** plus unpredictable downtime

**The managed IT route:**
- Full managed services at $175/user: $7,000/month
- Hardware lifecycle management (included or budgeted): $500/month
- **Total: ~$90,000/year** with predictable costs, proactive monitoring, cybersecurity, backup and disaster recovery, and a help desk your team can actually call

Yes, the managed option costs more on paper. But here's what you're buying:

- **Fewer outages.** Proactive monitoring catches problems before they become emergencies. Tools like [ConnectWise](https://www.connectwise.com/) and [NinjaRMM](https://www.ninjaone.com/) let MSPs see issues in real time and fix them before your team even notices.

- **Actual backups.** Not "we think it's backing up." Verified, tested, recoverable backups with solutions from providers like [Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/) or [Axcient](https://www.axcient.com/) that are tested regularly.

- **Compliance readiness.** If you're in healthcare, legal, or financial services, you need documentation that proves you're protecting client data. A good MSP provides that. Your nephew does not.

- **Strategic planning.** Someone is actually thinking about your technology roadmap — what needs replacing, what's coming next, how to support your growth.

When you factor in reduced downtime, fewer emergencies, lower cyber risk, and better employee productivity, managed IT typically delivers a 3-to-1 return on investment over the break-fix approach.

## A Simple Way to Evaluate Where You Stand

Here's a quick gut check. Answer honestly:

1. Do you know exactly what's being backed up right now? When was the last time you tested a restore?
2. Are all your computers running supported operating systems with current security patches?
3. Do you have multi-factor authentication on your email and financial systems?
4. Could you tell a client exactly how their data is protected if they asked?
5. Do you have a written plan for what happens if your main server dies tomorrow?

If you answered "no" or "I'm not sure" to more than two of these, you're running on borrowed time. It's not a question of *if* something goes wrong — it's when.

## The Bottom Line

Utah's business community is growing fast. We're seeing companies in Lehi, Provo, Salt Lake, and across the Wasatch Front scaling from 15 employees to 50, from one office to three. That growth is exciting — but it also means your IT needs are changing faster than most owners realize.

The businesses that thrive aren't the ones spending the least on IT. They're the ones spending *wisely* — turning technology from a source of frustration into a competitive advantage.
